"""# Fraud Detection Model Summary

This project aimed to build a robust machine learning model to identify fraudulent transactions effectively. Through data preprocessing, feature scaling, and balanced sampling, we refined our dataset for optimal model performance. Multiple models were trained, and the **Random Forest Classifier** demonstrated the highest predictive power.

### Key Results:
- **Training Set**:
  - **Accuracy**: 99.86%
  - **F1 Score**: 99.86%
  - **Precision**: 99.76%
  - **Recall**: 99.95%
  - **ROC AUC**: 99.86%
- **Test Set**:
  - **Accuracy**: 99.01%
  - **F1 Score**: 99.01%
  - **Precision**: 98.15%
  - **Recall**: 99.80%
  - **ROC AUC**: 99.05%

### Insights:
The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved a **99.01% accuracy** on the test set, with a high **ROC AUC of 99.05%**, indicating the modelâ€™s excellent capability to distinguish fraudulent from non-fraudulent transactions. This high performance makes it suitable for practical deployment in financial systems where accurate fraud detection is crucial.

### Conclusion:
The model has proven to be highly effective in detecting fraud, reducing potential financial risks. By tuning hyperparameters and employing balanced sampling, we achieved a reliable and accurate fraud detection model that can be integrated into real-world applications.
